<h3>Why are you interested in working with App Inventor? Please answer in at most 50 words.</h3>
<p>Before starting college I toured MIT Media Lab and loved all the projects. Then as a teacher I saw the value of Scratch and AppInventor. Now I would like to combine my technical and my education skills to help many more teachers and students than I can from my classroom.</p>
<h3>What experience do you have, if any, with teaching computer programming to beginners (including experience teaching about App Inventor)? Please describe this in at most 50 words.</h3>
<p>Starting as a college student I received a grant from NCWIT to create and implement a program to teach middle school girls to code. Since then I have taught 3 years as a full-time high school teacher and included AppInventor in my AP Computer Science Principles Curriculum.</p>
<h3>What would you like to work on this summer? You can select a project from the ideas list or propose your own project. If you do propose your own project, explain why this should be a priority for App Inventor development.</h3>
<p>Testing and Documentation: I would love to work within AppInventor to ensure that we are following and teaching only the highest standard of testing and documentation. On the more technical side, I want to work on Selenium Testing of the App Inventor UI. In addition, I agree with the desire of users to have better, more consistent documentation including availability in other languages and would like to work on this. I would also like to create better lesson modules that help students understand and create their own documentation and implement their own testing.</p>
<h3>Look back at your answer to the short-answer question about experience with the various technologies used in App Inventor development. For each technology where you indicated “extensive experience”, write a paragraph explaining your relevant experience. Include links to actual code and documentation that you’ve written.</h3>
<p>Java: I have programmed in Java for about 10 years including 3 years teaching Java as an AP Computer Science A instructor. I have taught and coded complex projects in everything from Greenfoot to GUIs in Netbeans. I competed in programming contests including Cal State Los Angeles’ ProgFest and The Wittry Memorial Programming Contest taking 1st place in my division in both. </p>

<p>Android Development: As a teacher of Computer Science A I piloted the College Board’s WE Service Coursework. I taught students how to create and publish applications aimed at solving local and global problems in Android Studio. These projects ranged from applications that informed users about diabetes, air quality, and drug addiction to apps that interfaced with an arduino and provided medication reminders on bracelets for seniors. My husband and I are currently working on an application using Java, Rest, and MongoDB to track users preferred meals.</p>
<br>
<p>Automated Testing: As a teacher and a programming contest organizer I regularly create JUnit tests to automate testing to determine students’ scores. In my Software Development Class we created a functioning web application that relied on over 5000 lines of python logic code to complete the main task and needed to be extensively tested to ensure functionality.</p>

<p>Google App Engine: I participated in Google’s Computer Science Summer Institute at MIT. We were tasked with creating one individual web application and one group web application. My individual application was a multiplayer web based version of the card game set. Our group based game was a computer version of the videogame DDR made in such a way that we could use the <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU”>MakeyMakey (go to 40 seconds)</a> to play with water buckets. After that experience I used the same technologies to make a prototype of scheduling software for Cal Performances.</p>

<h3>Describe what experience you’ve had working with other software developers and/or with large code bases. This can include class projects and an excellent StackOverflow reputation.</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Describe your design for how this would appear to App Inventor users. What new components or properties or methods would you add?</h3>
<h3>Explain how you would implement change. Would you extend the existing Camera component, or would you create a separate component? You should say which files in the source tree would need to be added and modified, and indicate how they would need to be modified, and how the modifications would take advantage of features in the Android SDK. You don’t have to provide running code, but you might want in include a couple of short code snippets at key points. Your explanation should be clear enough that another developer could do the implementation.</h3>
